# Stormworks Microcontroller Projects
This is a private collection of Stormworks microcontroller projects with no expectation of maintenance. The individual scripts are built using the "Stormworks Lua with LifeBoatAPI" VSCode extension.

Feel free to use the scripts in your own projects and provide credit if you use any script for a workshop creation.

For building the scripts on your machine you should change the paths in the settings file for "Lua.workspace.library"
